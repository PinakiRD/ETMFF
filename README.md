ETMFF: Elevating ECG Arrhythmia Classification via Transformer-based Multi-Faceted Feature Fusion
We have performed ECG arrhythmia classification using the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset** with our approach, **ETMFF** (Elevating ECG Arrhythmia Classification via Transformer-based Multi-Faceted Feature Fusion). The method involves extracting and integrating two distinct views of features from ECG signal data: **Morphological Features** and **Temporal Features**. The MIT-BIH dataset, consisting of 48 ECG recordings, has been carefully cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to extract these features. Currently, 5 processed data files are provided in the dataset folder, while the remaining processed files can be made available upon request.
